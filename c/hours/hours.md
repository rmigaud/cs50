# Hours.c Motivation

[problems 2 hours](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/problems/2/hours/)
Suppose you're taking CS50 (if you're reading this you probably are!) and spending time every week on each problem set. You may be wondering how many hours you've spent learnign computer science, on average or in total! In this program, you'll complete a function that calculates, based on a user's input, a total number of hours _or_ an average number of hours across a given number of days.

- To add up number in an array, you might first want to initialize a variable to zero. After, you'll want to use a loop that adds each value in the array to that variable.

- Be sure to pay attention to what happens if you divide two `int`s when calculating the average.

## Example output:

```
Number of weeks taking CS50: 3
Week 0 HW Hours: 3
Week 1 HW Hours: 7
Week 2 HW Hours: 10
Enter T for total hours, A for average hours per week: A
6.7 hours
```

```
Number of weeks taking CS50: 2
Week 0 HW Hours: 2
Week 1 HW Hours: 8
Enter T for total hours, A for average hours per week: T
10.0 hours
```

## Motivation

We seem to breaking records every year for the hottest weather ever recorded. Climate scientists keep track of what are called "new normals" over multiple years so that we can better predict and prepare for conditions in the near future. The official normals are calculated for a uniform 30 year period, and consist of annual/seasonal, monthy, daily, and hourly averages and statistics of temperature, percipitation, and other climatological variables from almost 15,000 U.S. weather stations.

July is the hottest month of the year for most large US cities. Daytime temperatures above 80 degrees Fahrenheit regularsly occur nearly everywhere. The exceptions are some cities along the Pacific coast.

In this problem, you will sort the average high temperature values for 10 cities, in descending order.

- When copying one `struct` to another, no need to assign individual elements. The entire `struct` can be assigned in one statement.

- Even though a `void` function cannot return any values, a `return` statement can be used to terminate the function.
